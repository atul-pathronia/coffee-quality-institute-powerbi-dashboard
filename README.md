## Capstone Project: Exploring Coffee Quality Data with Power BI

## About Dataset
The Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) is a non-profit organization that works to improve the quality and value of coffee worldwide. It was founded in 1996 and has its headquarters in California, USA.

CQI's mission is to promote coffee quality through a range of activities that include research, training, and certification programs. The organization works with coffee growers, processors, roasters, and other stakeholders to improve coffee quality standards, promote sustainability, and support the development of the specialty coffee industry.

### Data Description
The dataset includes a range of information on coffee production, processing, and sensory evaluation. It also contains data on coffee genetics, soil types, and other factors that can affect coffee quality.

#### Sensory Evaluations (Coffee Quality Scores)
- **Aroma**: Refers to the scent or fragrance of the coffee.
- **Flavor**: Evaluated based on the taste, including any sweetness, bitterness, acidity, and other flavor notes.
- **Aftertaste**: The lingering taste that remains in the mouth after swallowing the coffee.
- **Acidity**: The brightness or liveliness of the taste.
- **Body**: The thickness or viscosity of the coffee in the mouth.
- **Balance**: How well the different flavor components of the coffee work together.
- **Uniformity**: The consistency of the coffee from cup to cup.
- **Clean Cup**: Coffee that is free of any off-flavors or defects, such as sourness, mustiness, or staleness.
- **Sweetness**: Described as caramel-like, fruity, or floral, and is a desirable quality in coffee.

**Note**: 'Total Cup Points' is the total of the above features. 

#### Defects
Defects are undesirable qualities that can occur in coffee beans during processing or storage. Defects can be categorized into two categories: Category One and Category Two defects.

- **Category One Defects**: Primary defects perceivable through visual inspection, including black beans, sour beans, insect-damaged beans, fungus-damaged beans, etc.
- **Category Two Defects**: Secondary defects that are more subtle and can only be detected through tasting, including over-fermentation, staleness, rancidness, chemical taste, etc.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to leverage the rich dataset provided by CQI to understand the factors that contribute to coffee quality. Specifically, we aim to explore the following research questions:

1. What are the key determinants of coffee quality as evaluated through sensory attributes such as aroma, flavor, acidity, etc.?
2. Is there a correlation between processing methods, origin regions, and coffee quality scores?
3. Can we identify any trends or patterns in defect occurrences and their impact on overall coffee quality?
4. How do different variables interact to influence the Total Cup Points, which represent an overall measure of coffee quality?

## Instructions
Go through the dataset and documentation thoroughly. Feel free to explore more scenarios based on What-If analysis. Experiment with a wide range of visualizations and formulas.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Approach
1. **Data Import**: Load the dataset into Power BI.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and correct any inconsistencies in the data.
3. **Data Transformation**: Create new calculated columns and measures as needed.
4. **Data Visualization**: Create various visualizations to explore and understand the data.
5. **Dashboard Creation**: Compile visualizations into a comprehensive dashboard.

## Personal Learnings
- **Data Visualization**: Improved skills in creating interactive and insightful visualizations using Power BI.
- **Data Analysis**: Gained a deeper understanding of how to analyze complex datasets and extract meaningful insights.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Enhanced knowledge about coffee production and quality evaluation.
